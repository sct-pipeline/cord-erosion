# cord-erosion
Pipeline to erode the spinal cord mask in order to quantify MS lesions from the subpial surface.

This pipeline was tested on SCT commit e5eee1f18f4cc3655dc42c565ffac5b2453af2d1,
which can be installed as follows:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox.git sct-dev
cd sct-dev
./install_sct
# At anytime, you can update your local SCT installation to the latest version on Github:
git pull
~~~
